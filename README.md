In ancient Greek, the word metapherō means “to carry across.” In some ways, this is exactly what a metaphor does: it carries a shared quality or characteristic across two things or concepts of different natures. This is why a metaphor usually has two parts: the tenor and the vehicle. The tenor is the subject we’re trying to describe, while the vehicle is the object whose attributes we’re borrowing. In Shakespeare’s most famous “All the world’s a stage” monologue from As You Like It, "the world" is metaphorically assimilated to a stage, in which people are merely actors. Therefore, "the world" is the tenor, and "a stage" is the vehicle.

## Metaphor examples

Metaphors are used across disciplines and genres: You can find them in the most casual conversations, complex pieces of literature and diverse films. They allow any text to stand out and pull its audience into a new reality. 

##How to create your own metaphors

Coming up with your own metaphors can be difficult, but in reality, all you need is your imagination. Creating smart, visual and relevant metaphors is often what sets very good writers apart from the rest, showcasing an imaginative mind that is able to convey an image or a feeling through simple yet powerful comparisons. 

The first step is choosing the character, object or setting you’re trying to write about. Then, focus on the particular scene you’re describing. If you’re having trouble describing it, think of other objects that share characteristics with it. Now comes the fun part—take your metaphor and expand on it. Adding your own personal touch can go a long way. 

## How to use metaphors in your writing and speech

Metaphors can be incredibly useful because they add powerful detail to your writing. When you use metaphors, you bring your words to life and help the reader imagine and even feel certain emotions, scenes, or characters. It is important to remember not to mix metaphors and confuse your audience; that can actually take away from your work instead of enhancing it. 

Moreover, when you write, it’s essential to keep your audience in mind and choose your metaphors accordingly. If you’re writing for kids, there is no reason to use overly complex, extended metaphors that may not come across as clearly.

Finally, before you begin to include metaphors in your writing, remember why you wanted to use them in the first place. It is often when it's hard to explain something just as it is, and a comparison offers a useful reflection of the feeling you wanted to evoke. No need to overdo it. When it's easier to just explain something for what it is, ask yourself, is a metaphor necessary here?
